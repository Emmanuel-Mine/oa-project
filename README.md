# Open avenues project

We'll be working using the classes in this repository. You will all maintain a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of this repository. This means you'll periodically sync changes from the upstream repository when I upload new assignment notebooks or make other changes. This _also_ means that if you have changes (i.e. you've made some useful updates to rendering tools etc...) that benefit everyone in the group we can get your changes _into_ the upstream repository!

## Getting setup
