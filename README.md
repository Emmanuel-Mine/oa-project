# Open avenues project
We'll be working using the classes in this repository. You will all maintain a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of this repository. This means you'll periodically sync changes from the upstream repository when I upload new assignment notebooks or make other changes. This _also_ means that if you have changes (i.e. you've made some useful updates to rendering tools etc...) that benefit everyone in the group we can get your changes _into_ the upstream repository!

## Getting set up
- Create a github account and [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository
- Make sure you have python >3.8 installed on your machine
- Install [`pipenv`](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/). This is what we'll be using to install dependencies
- Clone your fork (see link above)
- Install the dependencies by running `pipenv shell` in the repository
- Run jupyter with `jupyter notebook`
- Check that you can run the first couple of cells of `1-introduction.ipynb`
